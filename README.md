<summary>Background</summary>

We've tried several tools including Akaunting (not familiar with PHP), InvoiceNinja (limited functionality), Crater, and Twenty CRM (consume too much CPU and RAM). We just want a tool that helps us create quotations, send invoices through email, and automate payments.

## üö¢ Deployment

### How the Kugie Team Deploys Summit

We use [Railway](https://railway.app/) for seamless deployment of the entire application stack:

* **Main Application:** The Next.js application is deployed directly on Railway, which automatically handles builds and deployments from the GitHub repository.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL is hosted as a Railway service, providing reliable database connectivity.
* **MinIO Storage:** File storage for receipts and documents is also hosted on Railway, eliminating the need for external S3 providers.
* **Webhook Processing:** For efficient webhook handling, the team uses Railway Functions with [Hono](https://hono.dev/) (a lightweight web framework). The webhook implementation can be found in the [xendit-webhook.js](xendit-webhook.js) file at the root of the project.

This infrastructure setup provides a cost-effective, reliable deployment that scales with usage while keeping all components within the same platform for easier management.

## üîÑ Webhook Integration

### Xendit Payment Webhooks
Summit is fully compatible with Xendit webhooks to automate your payment workflow:

* **Automatic Invoice Updates:** When a payment is completed through Xendit, the webhook automatically updates the corresponding invoice status to "Paid" in your Summit dashboard.
* **Real-time Slack Notifications:** Get instant notifications in your Slack workspace whenever a payment is received, keeping your team informed without manual checks.
* **Secure Verification:** All incoming webhook requests are verified using Xendit's callback verification token to ensure data integrity and security.

To set up Xendit webhooks:
1. Configure your Xendit dashboard to point to your Summit instance's webhook endpoint (`/api/webhooks/xendit`)
2. Ensure your `XENDIT_CALLBACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` is properly set in your environment variables
3. Configure Slack notifications by adding your Slack webhook URL to the environment variables:


## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Summit application running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   pnpm (or npm/yarn)
*   PostgreSQL Database
*   Minio Server (or other S3-compatible storage)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kugie-app/summit.git
    cd summit
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    See the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section below for details.

4.  **Set up the database:**
    Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running and the connection string in your `.env` file is correct. Then, run the database migrations:
    ```bash
    pnpm run generate && pnpm run push
    ```
    *Note: `generate` and `push` are suitable for development. For production, use `drizzle-kit generate` and apply migrations manually or via a migration tool.*

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

6.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### üîë Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require" # Your PostgreSQL connection string

# Authentication (NextAuth.js)
# Generate a secret: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="YOUR_NEXTAUTH_SECRET"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Use your production URL in deployment

# Client Portal Authentication Secret (Used for client portal JWTs)
# Generate a strong secret
CLIENT_AUTH_SECRET="YOUR_STRONG_CLIENT_PORTAL_SECRET"

# User Signup Control
# Set to "1" to disable new user signups
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_SIGNUP="0"

# Email (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY"
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="you@yourdomain.com" # Email address verified with Resend

# Payment Gateway (Xendit)
XENDIT_SECRET_KEY="YOUR_XENDIT_SECRET_KEY"
XENDIT_CALLBACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN="YOUR_XENDIT_CALLBACK_TOKEN" # Set this in Xendit dashboard

# File Storage (Minio/S3)
MINIO_ENDPOINT="localhost"
MINIO_PORT="9000"
MINIO_USE_SSL="false"
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="minioadmin"
MINIO_SECRET_KEY="minioadmin"
MINIO_BUCKET_NAME="summit"

# Cron Job Security
# A secret key to authenticate requests to the cron job endpoint
CRON_API_KEY="YOUR_SECURE_CRON_API_KEY"

# Application URL (Used for generating links in emails etc.)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Use your production URL in deployment
```

### üíæ Database Setup

This project uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL.

1.  **Ensure PostgreSQL is running.**
2.  **Set your `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file.**
3.  **Apply migrations (development):**
    ```bash
    pnpm run push
    ```
4.  **Generate new migrations (when schema changes):**
    ```bash
    pnpm run generate
    ```
    Then apply the generated migration script to your database.
## Docker Images

Last Stable Version: 1.0.0
```
docker pull geraldKugie/summit:1.0.0

docker run -p 3000:3000 -e <ENV_KEY>=<ENV_VALUE> geraldKugie/summit:1.0.0
```

Notes:
- On local builds, its simpler to run it from local directly without using docker, since you don't have to pass env vars one by one by using `-e <ENV_KEY>=<ENV_VALUE>`, or if you still want to containerize the app, use the `docker compose up` command for easier variable injection. 
- The image have been tested to deploy on railway, with all the envs provided, it will work perfectly. 
- Other methods such as implementing a specific config file for envs (e.g loki-config.yaml for loki) or passing a `.env` file are not implemented yet, but **will be implemented in the future.**
